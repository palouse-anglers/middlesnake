\title{Assign Each HUC12 Watershed to Its Dominant WRIA}
\usage{
assign_wria_to_huc12(
  huc12_sf,
  wria_sf,
  huc_id_col = "huc12",
  huc_name_col = "name"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{huc12_sf}{An \code{sf} object of HUC12 polygons. Must include numeric column for HUC12 values.}

\item{wria_sf}{An \code{sf} object of WRIA polygons.}

\item{huc_id_col}{Character name of the HUC12 ID column (e.g., "huc12").}

\item{huc_name_col}{Character name of the HUC12 watershed}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame}
}
\description{
This function intersects HUC12 watersheds with Water Resource Inventory Areas (WRIAs)
and assigns each HUC12 to the WRIA that overlaps it the most by area. Both input layers
are transformed to EPSG:5070 (NAD83 / Conus Albers) for accurate area calculation.
